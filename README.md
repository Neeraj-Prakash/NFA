This is a C program to simulate a NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automata).
  
This program takes multiple strings from a file as input.  
Then it process the input strings on the defined NFA in the header.  
And tells the string is accepted or rejected by the NFA.  
The output is stored in another output file.
